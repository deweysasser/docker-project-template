Docker Project Template
=======================

This project coordinates with the [build pipeline
template](git@github.com:deweysasser/docker-pipeline-template.git).

While the template is heavily docker biased but the pattern should
work with any system.

Defines the standard set of make targets for you to fill in later and
(if possible) provides reasonable defaults.

This project inherits (via git) the
[base-repo](https://github.com/deweysasser/base-repo) project.
